**TradeCloud** is a project that will allow users to run analysis on stock or cryptocurrencies prices.
Features the project are as such:
- `User TrackList`: So that users will have preferred tickers/symbols to track.
- `Plugin Executions`: So that users can create plugin executions, run/cancel/stop them. 
Each plugin might have output signals that can be drawn on a chart with price information. 
- `Notifications`: So that we can inform users about events such as plugin finish, signal generations etc.
Currently, websocket signals & email notifications are considered.
- `Trading`: So that users might bind their exchange APIs to automate position openings and closing based on generated signals.
- `Market`: Project will fetch necessary prices before running the analysis.
